Prompt Template (Simplified but Modern Styling)
Create a barebones, responsive website foundation with the following requirements:
Structure
Semantic HTML only (header, main, section, footer).


Components:


A header with site name/logo and simple nav.


A hero section with a heading, subheading, and a call-to-action button.


Basic typography styles for headings, paragraphs, and links.


A footer with copyright and minimal links.


Styling
Use pure, hand-written CSS only.


Do not use Tailwind, Bootstrap, shadcn, or any other CSS/UI frameworks or libraries.


Follow modern CSS best practices:


CSS variables (:root { --variable }) for colors, fonts, and spacing.


Fluid typography with clamp().


Media queries with a mobile-first approach.


Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.


Logical properties (e.g., margin-inline, padding-block) for better internationalization.


aspect-ratio for consistent media sizing.


Smooth transitions for hover states.


Modern units like svh/lvh for stable viewport sizing.


Dark/light mode support using prefers-color-scheme.


Include a minimal reset (* { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }).


Add accessible focus and hover states with clear contrast.


JavaScript
Use vanilla JavaScript only.


Do not use React, Vue, Angular, or any frontend frameworks/libraries.


Keep it minimal (e.g., toggle mobile navigation menu).


Design Direction
Allow me to choose:
Color palette: [vibrant / muted / pastel / monochrome / dark / light / earthy / futuristic].


Overall style: [minimalist / bold / playful / elegant / modern / retro / brutalist].


Tone of voice: [professional / casual / friendly / authoritative / inspirational].


Art direction: [flat / skeuomorphic / illustrated / geometric / organic / editorial / futuristic].


Typography style: [sans-serif / serif / monospace / modern geometric / humanist / display].


Spacing approach: [airy with lots of white space / compact and dense / balanced and modular].


Button and link style: [rounded soft edges / sharp geometric edges / subtle ghost buttons / bold filled buttons].


Imagery approach: [photographic / abstract shapes / minimal icons / custom illustrations].


Motion/interaction feel: [smooth and subtle / bold and snappy / minimal with almost no motion].


Layout personality: [centered single column / multi-column grid / asymmetrical / card-based].


Output
Deliver as separate HTML, CSS, and JS files (no bundlers, no build tools).


Ensure accessibility best practices (proper alt text, ARIA labels if needed, sufficient contrast).


The code should be well-commented, clean, and production-ready.
